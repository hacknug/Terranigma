Space Age features a weird mixed up soup of genres. It has point and click adventure style puzzles, it controls like a real-time strategy game, and it has both stealth and combat sections.

It's also quite tricky, so you're probably going to need a helping hand when navigating this weird alien landscape.

That's why we've put together a guide that will help you finish every level and unlock all the bonus objectives.

Simply follow Sergeant Goldman to finish this chapter.

**Bonus objectives**

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/space-age-bonus-1.jpg)

**An Explorer Explores** - Wander off from Goldman and find this apple tree to the east of the map to finish this objective.

## Mission 2 - Greenhorn

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/space-age-mission-2.jpg)

Go north, then follow the voice back to the southwest corner. Lead Private and Archer up to the far north. To control multiple characters at once, you want to draw a box around them with two fingers.

**Bonus objectives**

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/space-age-bonus-2.jpg)

**Keep Your Ears Open, Too** - Go straight to Mrs Archer by immediately heading for the bottom left corner of this map, before going too far north, to get a bonus.

## Mission 3 - Intelligence

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/space-age-mission-3-a.jpg)

Our job is to locate Cadet Periwinkle and Engineer Kowalski. Periwinkle is in the dead center of the map, to the northeast of your starting point.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/space-age-mission-3-b.jpg)

Kowalski is in the southeast corner, and has gotten himself trapped in this building. Tap on him to change character, then walk north and press the keypad. Change to Rookie and then walk into the building. Keep pressing the button as Kowalski until Periwinkle is in.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/space-age-mission-3-c.jpg)

Select both Kowalski and Rookie and then head to the beacon above.

**Bonus objectives**

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/space-age-bonus-3.jpg)

**Xenoarchaeology** - There's a weird object just to the right of your starting point. Go around the trees to find it, then examine the object to cash in the bonus.

## Mission 4 - Find Some, Lose Some

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Our job is to find the missing Maggie. Move the camera to the top left corner of the map and tap on the green truck. Drive over the metal ore on the left to pick it up and then drive south to the impound.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Take Rookie and crew north and follow Goldman to the spaceship.

**Bonus objectives**

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

**Getting it Right the First Time** - Pick up all the metal scraps in this top area, before driving south, to get the bonus.

## Mission 5 - Winfield

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

This mission is a flashback to Kansas. Start off by walking north to the area behind the house - just remember to wait until your mom is facing the opposite direction.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Investigate this hole in the fence to break it open. Your dog will then wander off into the secret military site.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Change control to your dog and then distract the technicians. Start by going below the stone L-shaped wall and then run up and go diagonally up behind the two computer terminals.

The men will chase you so loop back down and draw them across the perimeter line in the south.

**Bonus objectives**

**Smooth Sneaking, Whippersnapper** - Sneak past your mom without being seen. Restart the chapter if you get spotted.

## Mission 6 - Them

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Doc has been put in an impromptu prison. Our first job is to sneak by this alien dude. Go south and loop around to hide behind the trees here. When the alien walks up you can dash through the open door.

Or you can just shoot him (but you won't get the bonus objectives).

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

When you're inside, shoot this alien in the back to free Doc. Lasso the two characters and up through a door at the top. Go left and down (watching out for the alien on the left) to the southwest beacon.

**Bonus objectives**

**Avoided Mack** - Don't get spotted and don't kill the alien to the left of the prison

**Escaped Buddy** - Avoid getting spotted or shot by the alien patrolling the south of the prison.

## Mission 7 - What's Past is Prologue

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Start by going to the right, and pick up this pickaxe. Now follow the trail to the left as instructed.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Tap on the axe in your inventory and then on the large pile of rocks to clear them. Now follow the tracks and footprints up and around.

**Bonus objectives**

**Show and Tell** - Show the pickaxe (tap on the icon and then on a person) to all four crew members before using it on the rocks to get this bonus.

## Mission 8 - The Walls Speak

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

After a brief cutscene, walk to the far north of the map to find this scene. Grab a jar from the pile, then use it on the slime covered rock to the bottom left of the area to get a sample.

When you walk back to the jars the fireflies will come near you. Use the jar on them to catch them and create a makeshift lantern.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Now you can see where you're going in the temple. Sort of. Use your lantern with the top wall to illuminate the drawings.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

You now play as characters in this wall painting. Start by selecting the lower villagers then pick up the glowing ore. Give them both to the visitor.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

On this screen, give all four piles of ore to the visitor.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Build the temple by picking up rocks and placing them in the blueprint - one at a time.

**Bonus objectives**

There are no bonus objectives in this chapter.

## Mission 9 - Godspeed

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Follow this weird red path down to get to the crossroads. Explore all four paths (you'll want to go up first to get the bonus) and then return to the centre.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

You're now being chased big booming footsteps so get a move on. Follow the dog up, wait until there's a clear path, and then walk to the next area.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Select both the boy and Rookie and run down until they are both stood on the X markers. Then move each character separately down to the lower X markers when there's a clear path.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Turn on the gramophone to start the music. This will make the path on the left move. When it is below the boy, turn of the gramophone to stop the music and stop the path moving. Now move the boy down.

Turn the music on, and then off again when the path moves once. Make the boy walk left. Continue this process until the boy reaches the end.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

In this area, four bits of red path are switching position every half second, but they can be paused by flipping one of these switches. Flip the top switch when the leftmost path is joined up, like above. The second switch is stuck.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Flip the third switch when the third piece of path is in its lowest position like above. You will need to listen for the beat to know when to flip the switch because you can't see the path and switch at the same time.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Flip the fourth (bottom) switch when the leftmost piece of path is in its lowest position and is joining the path up to the X - like above. Again, you're going to need to use your ears and timing to get this right.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Now walk across the path, being careful to move as the middle both of path changes position. Run forward and allow yourself to be consumed by the darkness to wake up and finish this crazy chapter.

**Bonus objectives**

**Fall in love** - Go north at the crossroads before you see your mother to fall in love with Archer.

## Mission 10 - A Key Moment

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Don't go straight for the button. Instead wander down below the trees to find a building on the left.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Go in and wander in front of the security camera to set off the alarm. This will cause the alien to come investigate. Quickly dart through the gap on the left and then go down, run right, hit the button, and jump through the door before the alien comes back to his post.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

When this patrolling alien moves to the right, walk up and through this doorway on the left. (Or you could go through the one on the right - up to you).

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Use the keypad to go into this room in the top right of the compound and open the cabinet on the right to find the key. Now we have to get out alive…

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Go here and press the button on the right. Go in the room and use the computer to disable the life machines and lure the alien in through the left door. Quickly go out and lock both doors to keep the alien in.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Press this switch to open the door and finish the chapter.

**Bonus objectives**

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

**Absolute Empathy** - You need to finish this section without hurting the alien children. So, press the button on the right and then hit the button on the left. Let the alien chase you into the top room.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Loop around, run out of the door on the left and flip the switch to lock the door. Go and lock the right door too to keep the alien in and the children unharmed.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

**Poking the bear** - Look through the window on the left to tease the locked up alien.

## Mission 11 - Against All Odds

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

First things first, select the astronauts at the top and bottom of the screen and send them to the east to meet up with the guy in the car. Trust me.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Next, select Miss Archer and wait for your command. When you're told to activate the portable console, use the computer in the top left corner of the building.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

When you're told to hit the sterilisation chamber, use the big device in the top right corner. Then when it breaks, use Kowalski (the engineer chap to the left) to fix it. Your astronauts should be able to fend off the aliens.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

You need to find a spare Nucleo-Card. There's one in a building to the north east, but take some astronauts as backup as another alien will come and shoot Kowalski in the back.

Open the door with the switch and use Kowalski to get the card. Return it to the sterilisation chamber and use the field medic to heal any astronauts who are hurt.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

An alien is about to come from the North, so send your astronauts to the top of the building to fend them off. Then quickly go back inside the building and stand on the left to kill another alien.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

As Archer, head south and chat to the friendly alien to get some green goop. Then, go give it to Doc as medicine for private.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Head south and enter this greenhouse building. Take a blue flower and use it on the blender to the left. Do the same with the yellow flower. Then use the blender to make some delicious green goop. Take it back to the doc to save Private.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

As Private, go south and face off against the army of aliens. Don't worry, you'll defeat them quite easily.

**Bonus objectives**

**Mission Without Loss** - Don't let any astronauts get killed during the fights. Roll back to the last checkpoint if anyone gets vaporised and try again. Keep everyone in groups and use the field medic to heal up anyone who is hurt.

## Mission 12 - Fallout

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Go investigate the helmet.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

As Kowalski we need to get to this computer, which is to the north west of the nuclear warhead. You can go through with the other astronauts and use them to wipe out the aliens, or you can sneak through if you want to meet the bonus objective. Either way, use this computer.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

The next computer is actually just above us, but you'll need to venture left and then double back around to get to it. There's an alien nearby so you either need to sneak past when he's not looking or just put his ass on blast with your astronaut crew. YOLO.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Our last computer is in the southwest corner of this compound. There's an alien stalking around for you to avoid or kill, and an entire room of aliens that you definitely don't want to mess with. Luckily they won't notice Kowalski if he goes to the computer, from above, alone.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Use this guy to open the gate, then take your crew and roll north.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

The computer is here, past two dudes who can be avoided or killed at your discretion. Hey, I'm not judging you, Mr. Murderer. Now disable that fallback computer as Kowalski to finish this section and this chapter.

**Bonus objectives**

**No Senseless Violence** - Get through the mission without killing any aliens. Best bet is to take Kowalski on his own so you don't accidentally shoot anyone.

## Mission 13 - A Stranger's Place

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Pick up the newspaper. Repeatedly try to walk over the nucleum until Private lets in and wanders across it. Once you get through to the main room look at the blueprint, the picture, and use the horn a few times. Also, use the newspaper on the horn to finish the bonus objective. Then give the newspaper to the man.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Time to make an apple pie. Go to the kitchen and get the recipe book. Take a knife and use it on the apples. Take some water from the sink and some flour from the side and use them both in the bowl, and then mix it by using the bowl.

Take the rolling pin and use it on the dough. Place a crust, then the apple filling, and then the second crust into the pie dish. Take the pie, open the oven by using it, and then put the pie in the oven. Take the pie out.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

As Talby, go south to find ROBBY-1. There's some nucleum on the floor just north of ROBBY-1. Take it, and return it to your broken robot pal.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Go back to your ship to get a wrench and use it on ROBBY-1.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Talk to the aliens and then use the nucleum you get on your robot servant. Talk to the aliens again.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Go to the north, chat to the kids running around, and then ask this child for some nucleum. Use your bubblegum on yourself, then put the sticky goo in the jar. Use the jar on the fireflies to the north to make them follow you, then give the jar to Buckaroo. In return you'll get some nucleum.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Start to go north, then keep tapping Talby to advance the narrative. Then watch the cutscene to finish the chapter.

**Bonus objectives**

**Patience & Prudence** - After looking at the horn on the cabin wall a few times, use the newspaper on the horn to play a special song from your past.

## Mission 14 - Lord Servant of the Castle

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Have Archer press the switch just as the robots are in the top garages, and then quickly have Kowalski walk over to the left. As he's going, switch back to Archer and then repeatedly press the switch so the doors shut as soon as they open. If you get it right, Kowalski will be safely on the left, and Archer is out of harm's way on the right.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

As Kowalski go south and then sneak past the aliens to the switch on the right. You'll need to walk right, then go down, and then right again - avoiding the patrolling aliens at every turn.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

When you get to the button, copy what you did before but this time with Kowalski pressing the button and Archer running to the left.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Go back to where you came from with Kowalski, and then have you and Archer press the buttons in this northern section at the same time to open the gate. Send both characters through.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Next we're going to play as these four scouts. Go north and kill the alien duo. Then go up and kill the other aliens, but be wary of the laser turrets on your left: they'll murder your scouts in one hit. As long as one scout is left alive you can continue up and press the button to let Archer and Kowalski through.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Take control of Kowalski and then use the four machines in the room with the scout(s) to turn off the instant death turrets. Have Archer, Kowalski, and any alive scouts head left, past the deactivated turrets.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Look at this computer and you'll get an error message print out. Use it on Archer to read it, then give the message to Kowalski. Now use the switch as Kowalski to fix it and open the door on the left.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Now take control of Private. Go north, kill all the aliens, and wander through the gate you just opened.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Okay, boss battle time. First things first, kill all the tiny robots. Don't let them gang up on you, like above, or you'll be killed. Take them on one at a time until they're all dead and run away when your health is low to give it a chance to regenerate.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Give ROBBY-1 the runaround until he's out of energy and returns to the base (you'll see the red meter on the right deplete). Then defeat the second round of mini robots.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Once again, give ROBBY-1 the runaround and defeat his mini robots. But this time, there's a door open in the corridor that our other team members are in. You need to send Kowalski in and have him turn off the big red nucleum reactor. It's a bit of a juggling act, but you can do it.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Now, the next wave of junior robots won't be brainwashed and will fight alongside you make it a piece of cake to defeat ROBBY-1.

![]({{ site.spaceage }}/images/phantom-hourglass/zeldads293.jpg)

Go north. Grab Talby and Private and head down to finish Space Age. Congrats! That was a tricky one, eh?
